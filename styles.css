/* BEM notation to clearly name and structure your CSS to target block, elements and modifiers on the page */

 /* OOCSS to avoid duplication in your code. Remember, "block" styles will affect all cards whereas your modifier styles will change specific, or individual things, like the colour of your cards. */

/* No Ids BEM/OOCSS recommend avoiding Ids because Ids are unique which means they cannot be reused. Using classes avoids specificity wars (if everything is a class, everything has a specificity of 10 which is easy to remember and easy to override  */

/* Try not to select elements using their tag names. On large projects, targetting p when there are lots of ps can get dangerous! ðŸ™ˆ So again, give classes to everything. */
